/*
What do you expect to happen in both cases? What actually happens in both cases.
=> in let or var as well the values can be modified, whereas in const the value once assigned can't be reassigned. 
Well, the values of objects passed in const
can be modfifed. whereas the reference of other object/variable cannot be assigned as in to the defined 
const variable. 


What is the difference between an object declared as a let or a const variable?
the var objects can be updated, const cannot be updated. declaration of var objects can be done again, 
whereas cant do in case of const.
